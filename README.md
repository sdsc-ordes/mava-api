## Installation

### Prerequisites
This repository relies on nix and direnv.
- Clone the github repo.
- `cd mava-api`
- `just build`
- `just run`

## PoC

This is a PoC, for a connector to achieve interoperability between video metadata processing tools. It comes with the following building blocks:

- ontology for a common terminology
- api that allows to export and import into a graph that remains in memory.


### Ontology

- the ontology is provided in owl
- so far it has been kept pragmatic, aligned to the use cases TIBAV-A and videoscope

### API
- It establishes an API, that allows to import gradually into a graph and then exports the graph once it is ready
- The graph can also be cleared.
- Data can be imported from csv files or from Turtle files
- Data is exported as Turtle filed
